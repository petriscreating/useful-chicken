# Pick-this-up
This is a simple React web app that makes use of different public APIs to display various types of data. 
The app has no specific purpose, but is intended to showcase how different APIs can be used.

APIs that I used:   
- [Compliments Library](https://complimentr.com/)   
- [Insult Library](https://insult.mattbas.org/)   
- [Meme Library](https://meme-api.com)   
- [Random Useless Facts](https://uselessfacts.jsph.pl/)   
- [Leslie Knope Compliment Generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/knope)
- [Cheer me up](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cheer-me-up)
